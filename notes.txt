Ok so I got a master repo called cst336 setup and I did a first test and it supports pushing sub folders. I'll try to condense what I had to do really quick...

1) Make sure you have heroku cli set up on c9 or your local
```
> npm install -g heroku
> heroku login -i
```

2) Create your cst336 repo on your github, link it up with your c9 workspace
3) Make sure you're in your cst336 repo, link it up to a heroku app, let's say for hw2
```
heroku git:remote -a aa-19-hw2
```
(replace aa-19-hw2 with your heroku app)

4) Time to rename this remote. It gets added to git as 'heroku'. We don't want that.
```
git remote rename heroku heroku-hw2
```

5) When you want to deploy, you'll have to commit to git and push it up to heroku like this
```
git subtree push --prefix hw/hw2  heroku-hw2 master
```

(hw/hw2 is my sub folder, sub app i want to deploy to my hw2 on heroku)

6) done.


When you add want to deploy more sub folders just start from step 3)


I used these two guides and combined a combo of them to get this to work:
